# Kea 3.0: Logic Builders

between v2 and v3.

## Introducing Kea v3

Since [its origins](/docs/intro/what-is-kea#history) in 2016, Kea has always been on a mission to simplify frontend
development, keeping pace and adapting with technological trends as needed.

Since Kea 1.0, the last serious rewrite in 2019, trends have changed again. React 18 introduced Concurrent Mode
and added a hook that makes `react-redux` obsolete. ECMAScript modules have moved into the browser. TypeScript is in all the things.

Kea has changed as well. Instead of just being an alternative, though older take on [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/),
Kea _also_ provides standard solutions to common tasks like [routing](/docs/plugins/router),
[data loading](/docs/plugins/loaders), and [form handling](/docs/plugins/forms).

However, despite these plugins, it's been hard to extend Kea. Few people ever tried.

Starting with v3, all of this changes thanks to a system of cleverly nested _logic builders_.

This is the old version, Kea [2.0](https://v2.keajs.org/):

```ts
// Kea 2.x
import { kea } from 'kea'
import { githubLogicType } from './githubLogicType'

export const githubLogic = kea<githubLogicType>({
  actions: {
    setUsername: (username: string) => ({ username }),
  },
  reducers: {
    username: ['keajs', { setUsername: (_, { username }) => username }],
  },
  loaders: {
    user: [
      null as null | UserType,
      {
        setUsername: ({ username }) => api.fetchUser(username),
      },
    ],
  },
  listeners: ({ actions }) => ({
    setUsername: async ({ username }) => {
      console.log('username changed', { username })
    },
  }),
})
```

**Don't worry!**
This syntax [is guaranteed](/docs/meta/kea#kea-20-input-object-syntax) to be supported until at least January 19th, 2038.

It's not deprecated and it's not going away. It's just old, like "the old and the new gods" in Game of Thrones. They're still there.

Kea's new gods in 3.0 are **logic builders**. You pass an array of them to `kea()`:

```ts
// Kea 3.0
import { kea, actions, reducers, listeners } from 'kea'
import { loaders } from 'kea-loaders'
import { githubLogicType } from './githubLogicType'

export const githubLogic = kea<githubLogicType>([
  actions({
    setUsername: (username: string) => ({ username }),
  }),
  reducers({
    username: ['keajs', { setUsername: (_, { username }) => username }],
  }),
  loaders({
    user: [
      null as null | UserType,
      {
        setUsername: ({ username }) => api.fetchUser(username),
      },
    ],
  }),
  listeners(({ actions }) => ({
    setUsername: async ({ username }) => {
      console.log('username changed', { username })
    },
  })),
])
```

They look nearly identical, yet the biggest win is in this:

```ts
import { loaders } from 'kea-loaders'
```

Logic builders can come from anywhere. They can call each other. In fact that's exactly what `loaders` and `forms` do - there's no magic.
You don't need to initialize builders in a context, and you can make your own by nesting the other builders.

## Logic Builders

Each **logic builder** is a simple function that modifies the `logic`. Here's part of `actions`:

```ts
function actions<L, I>(input: I): LogicBuilder<L> {
  return (logic) => {
    for (const [key, payload] of input) {
      logic.actionsCreators[key] = createAction(key, payload)
      logic.actions[key] = (...args: any[]) => dispatch(logic.actionsCreators[key](...args))
      // etc...
    }
  }
}
```

The core logic builders are: [`actions`](/docs/core/actions), [`defaults`](/docs/core/defaults), [`events`](/docs/core/events), [`listeners`](/docs/core/listeners), [`reducers`](/docs/core/reducers), [`selectors`](/docs/core/selectors).

You can build all sorts of _highly practical_ abstractions on top of them, like [`forms`](https://github.com/keajs/kea-forms/blob/kea-3.0/src/builder.ts#L16)
and [`loaders`](https://github.com/keajs/kea-loaders/blob/kea-3.0/src/index.ts#L86).

While more illustrative than practical, here's a sample `setters` builder that combines `actions`, `reducers` and `listeners`:

```ts
import { kea, actions, reducers, listeners } from 'kea'

export const githubLogic = kea([
  setters({
    username: [
      'keajs',
      (username) => {
        console.log('Username changed:', username)
      },
    ],
  }),
])

function setters(
  input: Record<string, [defaultValue: any, onChange?: (value: any) => void]>
): void {
  const capitalize = (s: string) => `${s.charAt(0).toUpperCase()}${s.slice(1)}`
  return (logic) => {
    for (const [key, [defaultValue, onChange]] of setters) {
      actions({
        [`set${capitalize(key)}`]: (value) => ({ [key]: value }),
      })(logic)
      reducers({
        [key]: [defaultValue, { [`set${capitalize(key)}`]: (_, payload) => payload[key] }],
      })(logic)
      if (onChange) {
        listeners({
          [key]: (payload) => onChange(payload[key]),
        })(logic)
      }
    }
  }
}

// sample usage
githubLogic.mount()
githubLogic.values.username === 'keajs'
githubLogic.actions.setUsername('posthog')
// [console.log] Username changed: posthog
githubLogic.values.username === 'posthog'
```

## Logic Builder Codemod

To automatically convert all logic in the old syntax into the new syntax, run:

```shell
npx kea-typegen@next write --convert-to-builders
```

## Other new goodies

### The `kea-forms` plugin

There's a new plugin that greatly simplifies working with form data: `kea-forms`.

Check out [the kea-forms docs](/docs/plugins/forms) to learn more.

### Explicit `afterMount` and `beforeUnmount` builders

While `events` works like before, you can now use `afterMount` and `beforeUnmount` directly.

Here's a logic that flips a message once per second, for as long as it's mounted:

```ts
import { actions, afterMount, beforeUnmount, kea, reducers } from 'kea'

const pingPongLogic = kea([
  actions({ increment: true }),
  reducers({ counter: [0, { increment: (state) => state + 1 }] }),
  selectors({ message: [(s) => [s.counter], (counter) => (counter % 2 ? 'ping' : 'pong')] }),
  afterMount(({ actions, cache }) => {
    cache.interval = window.setInterval(actions.increment, 1000)
  }),
  beforeUnmount(({ cache }) => {
    window.clearInterval(cache.interval)
  }),
])
```

### New `propsChanged` event

There's an even easier way to sync data from React to a logic: `props`.

Here's an over-engineered textfield controlled by a logic via `props`. Overkill for now, but an useful template regardless:

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { kea, actions, reducers, listeners, props, propsChanged, path, useValues, useActions } from 'kea'
import type { textFieldLogicType } from './TextFieldType'

interface TextFieldLogicProps {
  value: string
  onChange?: (value: string) => void
}

const textFieldLogic = kea<textFieldLogicType<TextFieldLogicProps>>([
  props({ value: '', onChange: undefined } as TextFieldLogicProps),

  actions({ setValue: (value: string) => ({ value }) }),
  reducers(({ props }) => ({ value: [props.value, { setValue: (_, { value }) => value }] })),
  listeners(({ props }) => ({ setValue: ({ value }) => props.onChange?.(value) })),

  propsChanged(({ actions, props }, oldProps) => {
    if (props.value !== oldProps.value) {
      actions.setValue(props.value)
    }
  }),
])

export function TextField(props: TextFieldLogicProps) {
  const { value } = useValues(textFieldLogic(props))
  const { setValue } = useActions(textFieldLogic(props))

  return <input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />
}
```

### `useSelector`

There's a new `useSelector` hook that works just like the one from `react-redux`

```ts
import { useSelector } from 'kea'

function Component() {
  const value = useSelector((state) => state.get.my.value)
  return <em>{value}</em>
}
```

## Breaking changes

### No more `<Provider />`

It's no longer necessary to wrap your app in a `<Provider />` tag. If you still need it for interoperability,
use the one from `react-redux` with `<Provider store={getContext().store}>`.

If you're using react-redux's `useSelector` anywhere, it'll need to be nested within the `<Provider />` tag.
Switch to Kea's own `useSelector` to avoid this requirement.

### Auto-Connect inside listeners is going away

Kea v2.0 [introduced auto-connect](/blog/kea-2.0#auto-connect), which was mostly a good idea.

Auto-connect assured that when inside `myLogic` you:

- used `otherLogic.actions.increment` as a key in `reducers` or `listeners`
- used `otherLogic.selectors.counter` in `selectors`
- used `otherLogic.values/actions.bla` inside of a `listener`

... we'd automatically mount `otherLogic`, and kept it mounted in tandem with `myLogic`.

The first two points worked well, but automatically mounting `otherLogic` when touched inside a listener didn't work out.
It had subtle bugs due to the async nature of JS, and it's going away.

To safely migrate, upgrade to Kea `2.5.10+`, and set `autoConnectMountWarning` to `true`. Fix all errors you see,
by assuring that the logic is explicitly connected via [`connect`](/docs/meta/connect), or mounted some other way.
For example with a React hook like [`useMountedLogic`](/docs/react/useMountedLogic) before the rest of your app is rendered.

If you don't care if a logic you're trying to access is mounted, use [`.findMounted()`](/docs/meta/logic#logicfindmountedprops),
which returns `null` if it isn't.

### `autoMount: true` is also going away

There's was also an option to automatically mount a logic as soon as it was created. That's going away as well. If you
still need this, make a plugin. Something like:

```ts
import { KeaPlugin } from 'kea'

const automountPlugin: KeaPlugin = {
  name: 'automount',
  events: {
    afterLogic(logic) {
      logic.mount()
    },
  },
}
```

### Props merge

In earlier versions, the last used props overwrote whatever was there. Now props always merge:

```ts
const logic = kea([key(({ id }) => id)])
logic({ id: 1, value: 'blup' })
logic({ id: 1, other: true }).props === { id: 1, value: 'blup', other: true }
```

### No more `constants`

Instead of [`constants` from kea v2](https://v2.keajs.org/docs/api/logic#logicconstants), use [TypeScript Enums](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html).

### No more `PropTypes`

All support for [`prop-types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) is dropped. You can no longer pass them to reducers or selectors.

After 6 long years, it's time to bid farewell to this relic of the early days of React.

### Removed old `connect`

Now that we have builders, [`connect`](/docs/meta/connect) is the name of an exported builder.

The previous `connect`, which was literally defined as:

```ts
const connect = (input) => kea({ connect: input })
```

... is gone. Use the snipped above if you need it.

The old `connect` was useful in the [Kea v0 days](https://v0.keajs.org/), when React components were classes, and you used old decorators
to [connect actions and ~~props~~ values to components](https://v0.keajs.org/guide/connected).

Those days are gone, and so is the old `connect`.

### Remove `props` from `connect`

The `values` key in `connect` used to be called `props`. This was renamed to `values` and deprecated with Kea 1.0.
Now it's gone.

### Remove custom static payload

With Kea 3.0, an action can either be built with `true` (no payload) or a payload creator:

```ts
kea([
  actions({
    reset: true,
    increment: (amount) => ({ amount }),
  }),
])
```

Earlier versions allowed anything instead of `true`, and used that as the payload. If you still need that, just convert
it into a function.
