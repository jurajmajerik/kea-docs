## Introducing Kea v3

Kea 3.0 is the _"one small step, one giant leap"_ edition of Kea.

Best illustrated with an example.

This is Kea Version [2.0](https://v2.keajs.org/):

```ts
// Old syntax, Kea 2.0+
import { kea } from 'kea'
import { githubLogicType } from './githubLogicType'

export const githubLogic = kea<githubLogicType>({
  actions: {
    setUsername: (username: string) => ({ username }),
  },
  reducers: {
    username: [
      'keajs',
      {
        setUsername: (_, { username }) => username,
      },
    ],
  },
  listeners: ({ actions }) => ({
    setUsername: async ({ username }) => {
      console.log('username changed', { username })
    },
  }),
})
```

This is perfectly legit code in Kea 3.0. Everything works without problems.

However, there's a new abstraction in town.

For reasons mostly to do with _plugins_, _things calling other things_, and _reduction of complexity_, you might find it more convenient to pass `kea` an **array of logic builders** instead:

```ts
// New syntax, Kea 3.0
import { kea, actions, reducers, listeners } from 'kea'
import { githubLogicType } from './githubLogicType'

export const githubLogic = kea<githubLogicType>([
  actions({
    setUsername: (username: string) => ({ username }),
  }),
  reducers({
    username: [
      'keajs',
      {
        setUsername: (_, { username }) => username,
      },
    ],
  }),
  listeners(({ actions }) => ({
    setUsername: async ({ username }) => {
      console.log('username changed', { username })
    },
  })),
])
```

The code is virtually the same, and you can even run:

```shell
npx kea-typegen write --convert-to-builders
```

to automatically convert all logic in the old syntax into the new syntax.

## Logic Builders

So why the new syntax? In a word, composability.

Each **logic builder** is a simple function that modifies the `logic`. Here's part of `actions`:

```ts
function actions<L extends Logic = Logic, I = any>(input: I): LogicBuilder<L, ActionsType<I>> {
  return (logic) => {
    for (const [key, payload] of input) {
      logic.actionsCreators[key] = createAction(key, payload)
      logic.actions[key] = (...args: any[]) => dispatch(logic.actionsCreators[key](...args))
      // etc...
    }
  }
}
```

We have the core logic builders: [actions](/docs/core/actions), [defaults](/docs/core/defaults), [events](/docs/core/events), [listeners](/docs/core/listeners), [reducers](/docs/core/reducers), [selectors](/docs/core/selectors).

You can build all sorts of  _highly practical_ abstractions on top of them, like [`forms`](https://github.com/keajs/kea-forms/blob/kea-3.0/src/builder.ts#L16)
and [`loaders`](https://github.com/keajs/kea-loaders/blob/kea-3.0/src/index.ts#L86).

To demonstrate, here's a simpler `setters` builder:

```ts
import { kea } from 'kea'

export const githubLogic = kea([
  setters({
    username: [
      'keajs',
      (username) => {
        console.log('Username changed:', username)
      },
    ],
  }),
])

githubLogic.mount()
githubLogic.values.username === 'keajs'
githubLogic.actions.setUsername('posthog')
// [console.log] Username changed: posthog
githubLogic.values.username === 'posthog'
```

The `setters` builder just calls the building blocks - `actions`, `reducers` and `listeners` - with what is needed:

```ts
import { actions, reducers, listeners, BreakPointFunction } from 'kea'

function setters(
  input: Record<
    string,
    [defaultValue: any, onChange?: (value: any, breakpoint: BreakPointFunction) => void]
  >
): void {
  const capitalize = (s: string) => `${s.charAt(0).toUpperCase()}${s.slice(1)}`
  return (logic) => {
    for (const [key, [defaultValue, onChange]] of setters) {
      actions({
        [`set${capitalize(key)}`]: (value) => ({ [key]: value }),
      })(logic)
      reducers({
        [key]: [defaultValue, { [`set${capitalize(key)}`]: (_, payload) => payload[key] }],
      })(logic)
      if (onChange) {
        listeners({
          [key]: (payload, breakpoint) => onChange(payload[key], breakpoint),
        })(logic)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Builders opens up a whole new world of possibilities for Kea, comparable to what hooks did to React. 
To learn more, check out `pingPongLogic` below, and read through the [completely revamped documentation](/).

## Other new goodies

### The `kea-forms` plugin

There's a new plugin that greatly simplifies working with form data: `kea-forms`.

Check out [the kea-forms docs](/docs/plugins/forms) to learn more.

### Explicit `afterMount` and `beforeUnmount` builders

While `events` works like before, you can now use `afterMount` and `beforeUnmount` directly.

Here's a logic that flips a message once per second, for as long as it's mounted:

```ts
import { actions, afterMount, beforeUnmount, kea, reducers } from 'kea'

const pingPongLogic = kea([
  actions({ increment: true }),
  reducers({ counter: [0, { increment: (state) => state + 1 }] }),
  selectors({ message: [(s) => [s.counter], (counter) => (counter % 2 ? 'ping' : 'pong')] }),
  afterMount(({ actions, cache }) => {
    cache.interval = window.setInterval(actions.increment, 1000)
  }),
  beforeUnmount(({ cache }) => {
    window.clearInterval(cache.interval)
  }),
])
```

## Some dropped stuff

It's spring, the web has changed a lot since 2016, so it's time to get rid of some deprecations and bad ideas from the past.

### Auto-Connect inside listeners is going away

Kea v2.0 [introduced auto-connect](/blog/kea-2.0#auto-connect), which was mostly a good idea.

Auto-connect assured that when inside `myLogic` you:

- used `otherLogic.actions.increment` as a key in `reducers` or `listeners`
- used `otherLogic.selectors.counter` in `selectors`
- used `otherLogic.values/actions.bla` inside of a `listener`

... we'd automatically mount `otherLogic`, and kept it mounted in tandem with `myLogic`.

The first two points worked well, but automatically mounting `otherLogic` when touched inside a listener didn't work out. 
It had subtle bugs due to the async nature of JS, and it's going away.

To safely migrate, upgrade to Kea `2.5.10`, and set `autoConnectMountWarning` to `true`. Fix all errors you see,
by assuring that the logic is explicitly connected via [`connect`](/docs/meta/connect), or mounted some other way.
For example with a React hook like [`useMountedLogic`](/docs/react/useMountedLogic) before the rest of your app is rendered.

If you don't care if a logic you're trying to access is mounted, use [`.findMounted()`](/docs/meta/logic#logicfindmountedprops),
which returns `null` if it isn't.

### `autoMount: true` is also going away

There's was also an option to automatically mount a logic as soon as it was created. That's going away as well. If you
still need this, make a plugin. Something like:

```ts
import { KeaPlugin } from 'kea'

const automountPlugin: KeaPlugin = {
  name: 'automount',
  events: {
    afterLogic(logic) {
      logic.mount()
    },
  },
}
```

### No more `constants`

Instead of [`constants` from kea v2](https://v2.keajs.org/docs/api/logic#logicconstants), use [TypeScript Enums](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html). 

### No more `PropTypes`

All support for [`prop-types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) is dropped. You can no longer pass them to reducers or selectors.

After 6 long years, it's time to bid farewell to this relic of the early days of React.

### Removed old `connect`

Now that we have builders, [`connect`](/docs/meta/connect) is the name of an exported builder. 

The previous `connect`, which was literally defined as:

```ts
const connect = (input) => kea({ connect: input }) 
```

... is gone. Use the snipped above if you need it.

The old `connect` was useful in the [Kea v0 days](https://v0.keajs.org/), when React components were classes, and you used old decorators
to [connect actions and ~~props~~ values to components](https://v0.keajs.org/guide/connected).

Those days are gone, and so is the old `connect`.
