Kea 2.6 will be the last 2.x of Kea. Version 3.0 is just around the corner with [big changes](https://v3.keajs.org/blog/kea-3.0),
and version 2.6 is here to provide a smoother upgrade path.

- Update version requirements of peer dependencies: `reselect` 4.1+, `redux` 4.2+, `react-redux` 7+ and `react` 16.8+.
    If you're using React 18, upgrade `react-redux` to version 8+.

- React 18 support: Add a "redux listener silencing store enhancer", which prevents Redux's `useSelector`s from updating, when mounting a logic from within the body of a React component (e.g. with `useValues`).
    This effectively silences log spam in React 18 (`Warning: Cannot update a component (`Y`) while rendering a different component (`X`). To locate the bad setState() call inside `X`, follow the stack trace as described.`), and improves performance.

- Support custom selector memoization. Use [`memoizeOptions`](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect#defaultmemoizefunc-equalitycheckoroptions--defaultequalitycheck) as the 4th `selector` array value, which is then passed directly to reselect:

```js
const logic = kea({
    selectors: {
        widgetKeys: [
            (selectors) => [selectors.widgets],
            (widgets) => Object.keys(widgets),
            null, // PropTypes, will be removed in Kea 3.0
            { resultEqualityCheck: deepEqual },
        ],
    },
})
```

-   Set the `autoConnectMountWarning` option to `true` by default. Kea 2.0 introduced ["auto-connect"](https://keajs.org/blog/kea-2.0#auto-connect),
    and while it works great in reducers and selectors, automatically connecting logic in listeners turned out to be a bad idea.
    Thus, in Kea 2.6, when accessing values on an unmounted logic, you'll get a warning by default. In Kea 3.0, it will trigger an error.

```js
import { kea } from 'kea'
import { otherLogic } from './otherLogic'
import { yetAnotherLogic } from './yetAnotherLogic'

const logic = kea({
    // connect: [otherLogic], // should have been explicitly connected like this, or mounted outside the logic
    actions: { doSomething: true },
    listeners: {
        doSomething: () => {
            // This will now print a warning if `otherLogic` is not mounted.
            // Either add it to "connect" or make sure it's mounted elsewhere.
            console.log(otherLogic.values.situation)
        },
    },
    reducers: {
        something: [
            null,
            {
                // This `yetAnotherLogic` will still get connected automatically, not print a warning,
                // and not require `connect`. That's because it's connected directly at build time, whereas
                // in the listener, we're running within an asynchronous callback coming from who knows where.
                // While this works, it's still good practice to explicitly define your dependencies.
                [yetAnotherLogic.actionTypes.loadSessions]: () => 'yes',
            },
        ],
    },
})
```
