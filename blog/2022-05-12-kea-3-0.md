# Kea 3.0: Logic Builders

between v2 and v3.

## Introducing Kea v3

Since [its origins](/docs/intro/what-is-kea#history) in 2016 (it's been **six years???**), Kea has been on a mission to simplify frontend
development, keeping pace, and adapting with the technological winds of change, as needed.

Since the **last big rewrite in 2019**, things have changed again. React 18 introduced Concurrent Mode.
ECMAScript modules are in the browser. TypeScript is in all the things.

Kea's syntax hasn't kept up with the way Kea was being used, passing everything through a huge object keeps getting in the
way of extensibility, and it's time for a refresh. It's 2022 after all.

**Everything old will keep working**, but here's the new:

```tsx
// Kea 3.0
import { kea, actions, reducers, listeners, useActions } from 'kea'
import { loaders } from 'kea-loaders'
import { githubLogicType } from './githubLogicType'

export const githubLogic = kea<githubLogicType>([
  actions({
    setUsername: (username: string) => ({ username }),
  }),
  reducers({
    username: ['keajs', { setUsername: (_, { username }) => username }],
  }),
  loaders({
    repositories: [null, { setUsername: ({ username }) => api.getRepos(username) }],
  }),
])

export function Github(): JSX.Element {
  const { username, repositories } = useValues(githubLogic)
  const { setUsername } = useActions(githubLogic)
  return (
    <>
      <input value={userName} onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)} />
      <div>repos: {repositories.map((r) => r.name).join(', ')}</div>
    </>
  )
}
```

Can you spot the difference?

```tsx
// Kea 2.x
import { kea } from 'kea'
import { githubLogicType } from './githubLogicType'

export const githubLogic = kea<githubLogicType>({
  actions: {
    setUsername: (username: string) => ({ username }),
  },
  reducers: {
    username: ['keajs', { setUsername: (_, { username }) => username }],
  },
  loaders: {
    repositories: [null, { setUsername: ({ username }) => api.getRepos(username) }],
  },
})

export function Github(): JSX.Element {
  const { username, repositories } = useValues(githubLogic)
  const { setUsername } = useActions(githubLogic)
  return (
    <>
      <input value={userName} onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)} />
      <div>repos: {repositories.map((r) => r.name).join(', ')}</div>
    </>
  )
}
```

The old "it is not legacy" 2.0 syntax [is guaranteed](/docs/meta/kea#kea-20-input-object-syntax) to be supported until _at least_ January 19th, 2038.

The new "it already feels more solid" 3.0 syntax is called "Logic Builders", and it brings a few surprising benefits.

You pass `kea` an array of `LogicBuilder`s:

```ts
import { kea, actions, reducers, listeners, useActions } from 'kea'
import { loaders } from 'kea-loaders'

const logic = kea([
  // put the `LogicBuilder`-s here 👍
  actions({}),
  reducers({}),
  loaders({}),
])
```

And get a `logic` in return.

But why are the logic builders in an array, and why is this syntax better than the old one?

Let's explore.

## Logic Builders

Each _logic builder_ is nothing more than a function that modifies the `logic`.

```ts
function actions(input) {
  return (logic) => {
    // do something to `logic`, based on `input`
  }
}
```

Here's a [peek](https://github.com/keajs/kea/blob/557ff6cddf2f2e880a75faa6bfb6ca3cb910a890/src/core/actions.ts#L17-L24) inside the core `actions` builder to show how un-magical it all is:

```ts
function actions<L, I>(input: I): LogicBuilder<L> {
  return (logic) => {
    for (const [key, payload] of input) {
      logic.actionsCreators[key] = createAction(key, payload)
      logic.actions[key] = (...args: any[]) => dispatch(logic.actionsCreators[key](...args))
      // etc...
    }
  }
}
```

The core logic builders are: [`actions`](/docs/core/actions), [`defaults`](/docs/core/defaults), [`events`](/docs/core/events), [`listeners`](/docs/core/listeners), [`reducers`](/docs/core/reducers), [`selectors`](/docs/core/selectors).

While putting logic builders in an array to create `logic` is great fun, their real power comes from the realisation that **logic builders can call other logic builders!** 💡

With this insight, you can build all sorts of clever and _highly practical_ abstractions, like [`loaders`](https://github.com/keajs/kea-loaders/blob/kea-3.0/src/index.ts#L81)
and [`forms`](https://github.com/keajs/kea-forms/blob/kea-3.0/src/builder.ts#L16):

```ts
const logic = kea([
  forms({
    loginForm: {
      defaults: { user: '', pass: '' },
      errors: ({ user, pass }) => ({
        user: !user ? 'Please enter a user' : '',
        pass: !pass ? 'Please enter a passwqord' : '',
      }),
      submit: ({ user, pass }) => {
        authLogic.actions.initLogin(user, pass)
      }
    },
  })
])

export function forms<L extends Logic = Logic>(
  input: FormDefinitions<L> | ((logic: BuiltLogic<L>) => FormDefinitions<L>),
): LogicBuilder<L> {
  return (logic) => {
    const forms = typeof input === 'function' ? input(logic) : input
    for (const [formKey, formObject] of Object.entries(forms)) {
      const capitalizedFormKey = capitalizeFirstLetter(formKey)

      actions({
        [`set${capitalizedFormKey}Value`]: (name: FieldName, value: any) => ({ name, value }),
        [`reset${capitalizedFormKey}`]: (values?: Record<string, any>) => ({ values }),
        [`submit${capitalizedFormKey}`]: true,
        [`submit${capitalizedFormKey}Success`]: (formValues: Record<string, any>) => ({ [formKey]: formValues }),
        [`submit${capitalizedFormKey}Failure`]: (error: Error) => ({ error }),
      })(logic)

      if (formObject.defaults) {
        defaults({
          [formKey]: formObject.defaults,
        })(logic)
      }

      reducers({
        [formKey]: {
          [`set${capitalizedFormKey}Value`]: (
            state: Record<string, any>,
            { name, value }: { name: FieldName; value: any },
          ) => deepAssign(state, name, value),
          [`reset${capitalizedFormKey}`]: (state: Record<string, any>, { values }: { values: Record<string, any> }) =>
            values || formObject.defaults || {},
        },
// and so on
```

## Logic Builder Codemod

To automatically convert all logic into the new syntax, run:

```shell
npx kea-typegen@next write --convert-to-builders
```

## New Features

### The official `kea-forms` plugin

As alluded earlier, there's a new plugin that greatly simplifies working with form data: [`kea-forms`](/docs/plugins/forms).

```tsx
import { kea } from 'kea'
import { forms, Form, Field } from 'kea-forms'
const loginLogic = kea([
  forms({
    loginForm: {
      defaults: { user: '', pass: '' },
      errors: ({ user, pass }) => ({
        user: !user ? 'Please enter a user' : '',
        pass: !pass ? 'Please enter a passwqord' : '',
      }),
      submit: ({ user, pass }) => {
        authLogic.actions.initLogin(user, pass)
      },
    },
  }),
])

export function LoginForm(): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <Form logic={loginLogic} formKey="loginForm" enableFormOnSubmit>
      {/* `value` and `onChange` are passed automatically to children of <Field> */}
      <Field name="user">
        <input type="text" />
      </Field>
      <Field name="pass">
        <input type="password" />
      </Field>
      <button type="submit">Login!</button>
    </Form>
  )
}
```

### Explicit `afterMount` and `beforeUnmount` builders

While `events({ afterMount: () => {} })` works like before, you can now use `afterMount` and `beforeUnmount` directly.

Here's a logic that flips a message once per second, for as long as it's mounted:

```ts
import { actions, afterMount, beforeUnmount, kea, reducers } from 'kea'

const pingPongLogic = kea([
  actions({ increment: true }),
  reducers({ counter: [0, { increment: (state) => state + 1 }] }),
  selectors({ message: [(s) => [s.counter], (counter) => (counter % 2 ? 'ping' : 'pong')] }),
  afterMount(({ actions, cache }) => {
    cache.interval = window.setInterval(actions.increment, 1000)
  }),
  beforeUnmount(({ cache }) => {
    window.clearInterval(cache.interval)
  }),
])
```

### New `propsChanged` event

Instead of hacky `useEffect` loops, there's a new way to sync data from React's props to a logic: the `propsChanged` event,
which fires whenever React calls a logic with a new set of props.

Here's an over-engineered textfield that's controlled directly through `props`.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import {
  kea,
  actions,
  reducers,
  listeners,
  props,
  propsChanged,
  path,
  useValues,
  useActions,
} from 'kea'
import type { textFieldLogicType } from './TextFieldType'

interface TextFieldLogicProps {
  value: string
  onChange?: (value: string) => void
}

const textFieldLogic = kea<textFieldLogicType<TextFieldLogicProps>>([
  props({ value: '', onChange: undefined } as TextFieldLogicProps),

  actions({ setValue: (value: string) => ({ value }) }),
  reducers(({ props }) => ({ value: [props.value, { setValue: (_, { value }) => value }] })),
  listeners(({ props }) => ({ setValue: ({ value }) => props.onChange?.(value) })),

  propsChanged(({ actions, props }, oldProps) => {
    if (props.value !== oldProps.value) {
      actions.setValue(props.value)
    }
  }),
])

export function TextField(props: TextFieldLogicProps) {
  const { value } = useValues(textFieldLogic(props))
  const { setValue } = useActions(textFieldLogic(props))

  return <input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />
}
```

### New `subscriptions` plugin

When [listeners](/docs/core/listeners) let listen to actions that change values, [subscriptions](/docs/plugins/subscriptions) listen
to changes in values themselves, no matter where the change orignated from:

```ts
import { kea, actions, reducers } from 'kea'
import { subscriptions } from 'kea-subscriptions'

const logic = kea([
  actions({ setMyValue: (value) => ({ value }) }),
  reducers({ myValue: ['default', { setMyValue: (_, { value }) => value }] }),
  subscriptions({ myValue: (value, oldValue) => console.log({ value, oldValue }) }),
])

logic.mount()
// [console.log] { value: 'default', oldValue: undefined }
logic.actions.setMyValue('coffee')
// [console.log] { value: 'coffee', oldValue: 'default' }
logic.actions.setMyValue('bagels')
// [console.log] { value: 'bagels', oldValue: 'coffee' }
```

### `useSelector`

There's a new `useSelector` hook that works just like the one from `react-redux`

```ts
import { useSelector } from 'kea'

function Component() {
  const value = useSelector((state) => state.get.my.value)
  return <em>{value}</em>
}
```

## Breaking changes

### No more peer dependencies

Feel free to remove `redux`, `react-redux` and `reselect` from your dependencies, unless you're using them directly.

Kea 3.0 removes `react-redux` (replaced via React 18's `useSynExternalStore` and its shim for older versions),
and inlines packages `redux` and `reselect` directly. The `kea` package, and the various plugins, are all you need.

### No more `<Provider />`

It's no longer necessary to wrap your app in a `<Provider />` tag. If you still need it for interoperability,
use the one from `react-redux` with `<Provider store={getContext().store}>`.

If you're using `react-redux`'s `useSelector`, it'll need to be nested within the `<Provider />` tag.
Switch to Kea's own `useSelector` to avoid this requirement.

### Auto-Connect inside listeners is going away

Kea v2.0 [introduced auto-connect](/blog/kea-2.0#auto-connect), which was mostly a good idea. There's one place it
didn't work:

```ts
const logic = kea({
  listeners: {
    getBread: () => {
      shopLogic.actions.knockDoor()
    },
  },
})
```

Starting with Kea 2.0+, if `shopLogic` was not explicitly mounted, it would get mounted when accessed from within a listener.

It was a great idea, but came with subtle bugs due to the async nature of JS, and it's going away.

To safely migrate, upgrade to [Kea `2.6.0`](https://keajs.org/blog/kea-2.6), which will warn about automatically mounted logic.
Fix all the notices, and make sure all logic is explicitly connected via [`connect`](/docs/meta/connect), manually mounted, or mounted through a React hook.

You can also call something like [`userLogic.findMounted()`](/docs/meta/logic#logicfindmountedprops), to access a logic only if it's mounted.

### `autoMount: true` is also going away

There's was also an option to automatically mount a logic as soon as it was created. That's going away as well. If you
still need this, make a plugin with an `afterLogic` hook.

### Props merge

In earlier versions, the last used props overwrote whatever was there. Now props always merge:

```ts
const logic = kea([key(({ id }) => id)])
logic({ id: 1, value: 'blup' })
logic({ id: 1, other: true }).props === { id: 1, value: 'blup', other: true }
```

### No more `constants`

Instead of [`constants` from kea v2](https://v2.keajs.org/docs/api/logic#logicconstants), use [TypeScript Enums](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html).

### No more `PropTypes`

All support for [`prop-types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) is dropped. You can no longer pass them to reducers or selectors.

After 6 long years, it's time to bid farewell to this relic of the early days of React.

### Removed old `connect`

Now that we have builders, [`connect`](/docs/meta/connect) is the name of an exported builder.

The previous `connect`, which was literally defined as:

```ts
const connect = (input) => kea({ connect: input })
```

... is gone. Use the snipped above if you need it.

The old `connect` was useful in the [Kea v0 days](https://v0.keajs.org/), when React components were classes, and you used old decorators
to [connect actions and ~~props~~ values to components](https://v0.keajs.org/guide/connected).

Those days are gone, and so is the old `connect`.

### Remove `props` from `connect`

The `values` key in `connect({ actions: [], values: [] })` used to be called `props`. This was renamed to `values` and deprecated with Kea 1.0.
Now it's gone.

### Remove custom static payload

With Kea 3.0, an action can either be built with `true` (no payload) or a payload creator:

```ts
kea([
  actions({
    reset: true,
    increment: (amount) => ({ amount }),
  }),
])
```

Earlier versions allowed anything instead of `true`, and used that as the payload. If you still need that, just convert
it into a function.
