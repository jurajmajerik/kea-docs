# What is Kea?

<WebDev />

## Heavyweight state management for React

Kea is a complete framework for managing state in [React](https://reactjs.org/) webapps.

Kea organises state in containers called `logic`. Each logic groups related actions and values E.g. `loginFormLogic`,
`profileLogic`, `routeLogic`.
. Each logic is built by running `logic builders`, which give it
features like `actions` or `values`.

Kea doesn't limit itself to simple state management. Kea _also_ provides standard solutions to common tasks like [routing](/docs/plugins/router),
[data loading](/docs/plugins/loaders), and [form handling](/docs/plugins/forms). All through cleverly nested _logic builders_.

## What's a logic?

A [`logic`](/docs/meta/logic) is created by passing an array of logic builders to [`kea([])`](/docs/meta/kea), such as [`actions()`](/docs/core/actions) and [`reducers()`](/docs/core/reducers):

For example:

```ts
import { kea, actions, reducers } from 'kea'

const loginLogic = kea([
  actions({
    setUsername: (username: string) => ({ username }),
  }),
  reducers({
    username: ['keajs', { setUsername: (_, { username }) => username }],
  }),
])
```

Here we created a logic with one action, `setUsername`, and one value, exposed through a `username` reducer.

The resulting `loginLogic` can be used directly:

```ts
loginLogic.mount()
loginLogic.actions.setUsername('posthog')
loginLogic.values.username === 'posthog'
```

... or with [hooks](/docs/react/) in a React component, to tie its `mount`/`unmount` lifecycle to the component's.

```tsx
import { useValues, useActions } from 'kea'

function Login() {
  const { setUsername } = useActions(loginLogic)
  const { username } = useValues(loginLogic)
  // ...
}
```

## Core building blocks

Just like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), Kea uses [`actions`](/docs/core/actions), [`reducers`](/docs/core/reducers), and [`selectors`](/docs/core/selectors) as its core building blocks.

These provide a stable foundation that all other features are built on.

- Think of [`actions`](/docs/core/actions) as a unified messaging bus that every part of your app uses to communicate.
- Think of [`reducers`](/docs/core/reducers) as the only "write" operation in the entire system, and only in response to actions.
- Think of [`selectors`](/docs/core/selectors) as the only "read" operation in the entire system. They're exposed as [`values`](/docs/meta/logic#logicvalues), and also act as the computed caching layer.

You can run side-effects in response to actions with [`listeners`](/docs/core/listeners), or subscribe to changes in values with [`subscriptions`](/docs/plugins/subscriptions).

There are plugins that simplify data [`loading`](/docs/plugins/loaders), [`forms`](/docs/plugins/forms), [`routing`](/docs/plugins/router), and [other common tasks](/docs/plugins/).

## Data layer

When fully deployed, Kea acts as a separate [data layer](/blog/data-first-frontend-revolution), which communicates with
React through a strict boundary of `actions`, `props` and `values`. You should aim to keep as much of your data, and its manipulations
within Kea's _data layer_, leaving React to do an amazing job as the _view layer_.

That's right, MVC is back, but it's just D&V this time!

Kea discourages the use of `useState` and `useEffect` for local scene data, because local state inevitably becomes global.

Kea discourages the use of `Context` because you shouldn't re-render everything, everytime, always, everytime. Always.

Kea believes that it's hard enough to get your data layer right, so why burden yourself even more, by cramming it in a DOM-like tree of React nodes?

Kea thinks layers shield complexity, and promote simplicity. [Bring back the layers!](/blog/data-first-frontend-revolution)

To take full advantage of Kea, think of it as a self-sufficient data layer between your APIs and React, shielding both from each other:

## How to learn Kea?

Start by reading through the [Core](/docs/core/) and [Meta](/docs/meta/) sections in the sidebar, and then just [going for it](/docs/intro/installation).

You can also have a look at a 30min [video tutorial](/docs/tutorials/intro) as well.

## History

The Kea project began in 2015 when I took on a job to build an app with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

Redux of 2015 was fine, but I kept writing very similar code over and over again. Its main criticism at the time was "too much boilerplate",
thus _back then_ everyone invented their own abstractions. This includes the Redux maintainers themselves, but only later in 2018 with [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/).

We're still in 2015. My loose collection of helper functions grew into the first public release of Kea,
version 0.1 at the start of 2016. By 2019, over three years, this had gradualy evolved into a unified _high level abstraction over Redux_ with Kea [0.28](https://v0.keajs.org/).

I had developed several large webapps with Kea and the [kea-saga](/docs/plugins/saga) plugin by then. It felt like coding at the bleeding
edge of React + Redux development.

Then, in 2019, something happened. [React v16.8](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html) introduced [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html),
and to keep up, Kea went through a long [1.0](https://v1.keajs.org/) rewrite (5+ months of hard work over 300+ commits), introduced [listeners](/docs/core/listeners)
to replace sagas, and soon made things even simpler with [Kea 2.0](/blog/kea-2.0/). Years 2020-2021 saw innovation in [type generation](/docs/intro/typescript),
the maturation of the [loaders](/docs/plugins/loaders) and [router](/docs/plugins/router) plugins, a new [testing](/docs/intro/testing) framework, and
a solidification of a [data-first mindset](/blog/data-first-frontend-revolution) to guide development.

Now in early 2022, it's time for yet another shift. [Kea 3.0](/blog/kea-3.0/) introduces [builders](/docs/intro/what-is-kea#logic-builders),
making it possible to build abstractions on top of Kea easier than before. The new [`kea-forms`](/docs/plugins/forms) plugin
takes full advantage of this new power.

## What's a "kea"?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kea):

> The kea (/ˈkiːə/; Māori: [kɛ.a]) is a species of large parrot
> found in the forested and alpine regions of the South Island of New Zealand.
>
> Kea are known for their intelligence and curiosity. Kea can solve logical puzzles, such as pushing
> and pulling things in a certain order to get to food, and will work together to achieve a certain
> objective.

[Check out some videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kea+the+smartest+parrot) to see
this magnificent bird in action.

Kea the parrot always finds the shortest and the smartest way to achieve a goal, such as getting food
from a maze.

Kea the framework follows a similar approach. It offers a simple and straightforward solution
to the complicated problem of state management.

Plus, when I started to learn React, I was on a plane back to Belgium from a holiday in New Zealand,
having just [seen the bird](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5DNXZWCKtYveeu8c9) a week before... and the name was
available on `npm`.
