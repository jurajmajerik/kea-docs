:::note
This document gives a **very brief** overview of how Kea works. Please read 
[Core Concepts](/docs/guide/concepts) to read not only *what* you can do in Kea, but also *why*. 
It's required reading if you are starting to use Kea in an actual app.

:::note Another note
If you prefer to build a working app as you follow along, skim through this page to get a basic 
overview and then follow the [Github API](/docs/tutorials/github) tutorial.

## Logic

All Kea code lives inside a `logic`, which is created by calling `kea()`

```javascript
import { kea } from 'kea'

const logic = kea({ ... })
```

## Actions

Every operation in Kea start with an action:

```javascript
const logic = kea({
    actions: {
        addToCounter: (amount) => ({ amount }),
        setName: (name) => ({ name }),
        submitForm: (values, page) => ({ values, page }),
        actionWithoutArguments: true        
    }
})
```

Think of actions as events that are dispatched onto a queue. On their own they do nothing.
Reducers and listeners (explained below) wait for actions and react accordingly.

Actions are functions that take whatever arguments you choose and return a `payload`. 
This payload should always be an object: `(amount) => ({ amount })`.

You call actions in React through the `useActions` hook:

```jsx
import { useActions } from 'kea'

function BigButton () {
    const { addToCounter } = useActions(logic)

    return (
        <button onClick={() => addToCounter(1000)}>
            Add one thousand! ü§©
        </button>
    )
}
```

Clicking this button dispatches an action with the payload `{ amount: 1000 }`

## Reducers

Reducers hold your state and modify it in response to actions:

```javascript
const logic = kea({
    actions: {
        increment: (amount) => ({ amount }),
        decrement: (amount) => ({ amount })
    },
    reducers: {
        counter: [0, { 
            increment: (state, { amount }) => state + amount,
            decrement: (state, { amount }) => state - amount,
        }]
    }
})
```

To create a reducer, you provide it with a list of actions that modify its state (the keys of the object above) and how
(the values of the same object).

Each change is described by a function that gets two arguments: the current `state` of the reducer and the `payload` of 
the action that was dispatched. 

Reducers must **never** mutate values. When dealing with complex objects, 
always create and return a new object that incorporates the required changes.

```javascript
{
  addTodo: (state, { todo }) => [...state, todo], // ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Always do this!
  addTodo: (state, { todo }) => state.push(todo), // ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è NEVER do this!
}
```

You are also not allowed to make API calls or dispatch actions inside a reducer.

To access the data stored in reducers from React, use the `useValues` hook:

```jsx
import { useValues } from 'kea'

function Counter() {
    const { counter } = useValues(logic)

    return <div>Current counter: {counter}</div>
}
```

## Listeners

All API calls and other side effects must happen inside `listeners`.

```javascript
const logic = kea({
    actions: {
        loadUsers: true,
        setUsers: users => ({ users })
    },

    listeners: {
        loadUsers: async () => {
            const users = await api.get('users')
            actions.setUsers(users)
        } 
    },

    reducers: {
        users: [[], {
            setUsers: (_, { users }) => users
        }]  
    }
})
```

Listeners and reducers can and should reuse actions whenever possible. That's why actions are defined separately.
For example you can add a `isLoading` reducer that sets its state to `true` when the `loadUsers` action is dispatched
and to `false` when `setUsers` is dispatched after.

## Selectors

Selectors combine reducers and other selectors into new pre-calculated values.

Each reducer has a selector made for it automatically, which you can use as input in new selectors:

```javascript
const logic = kea({
    actions: {
        setMonth: (month) => ({ month }),
        setRecords: (records) => ({ records })
    },
    reducers: {
        month: ['2020-04', {
            setMonth: (_, { month }) => month
        }],
        records: [[], {
            setRecords: (_, { records }) => records
        }]  
    },
    selectors: {
        recordsForSelectedMonth: [
            (selectors) => [selectors.month, selectors.records],
            (month, records) => {
                return records.filter(r => r.month === month)
            }
        ]
    }
})
```

Get the output of a selector in React with `useValues`, just like with reducers:

```javascript
const { recordsForSelectedMonth } = useValues(logic)
```

Selectors are recalculated only when their input changes. They are perfect for memoizing complex operations.

Selectors are actually functions that take the redux store's current `state` as an argument and return
whatever value you're looking for:
 
```javascript
logic.selectors.month = state => state.path.to.logic.in.redux.month
logic.selectors.month(store.getState()) == '2020-04'
```  

## Values

Values are a shorthand to access the current state of selectors. 

```javascript
logic.values.month === logic.selectors.month(store.getState())
```

You mostly use them in listeners to fetch some value:

```javascript
const logic = kea({
    // actions, reducers, ...

    listeners: ({ actions, values }) => ({
        fetchDetails: async () => {
            const { username } = values // üëà get the latest username
            const details = await api.fetchDetails({ username })
            actions.setDetails(details)
        }
    })
})
```

This is where the hook `useValues` gets its name.

```jsx
import { useValues } from 'kea'

function Counter() {
    const { counter } = useValues(logic)

    return <div>Current counter: {counter}</div>
}
```
