## Logic

All Kea code lives inside a `logic`, which is created by calling `kea()`

```ts
import { kea } from 'kea'

const logic = kea([ ... ])
```

<details>
  <summary>Why do we call it `logic`?</summary>
  <div>
    Well, we had to call it something and everything else was already taken. ðŸ˜…
   
    More seriously, the name `logic` implies that calling `kea()` return complex objects,
    which not only contain a piece of your state, but also all the _logic_ that manipulates it.
   
    It's a useful convention, and I suggest sticking to it. Feel free to call your logic with
    names that make sense, such as `accountLogic`, `dashboardLogic`, etc.
  </div>
</details>

## Logic builders

You pass `kea([])` an array of function calls, each of which add certain features to your `logic`. 

For example `actions` and `reducers`:

```ts
import { kea, actions, reducers } from 'kea'
import { loginLogicType } from './loginLogicType'

export const loginLogic = kea<loginLogicType>([
  actions({
    setUsername: (username: string) => ({ username }),
  }),
  reducers({
    username: { setUsername: (_, { username }) => username },
  }),
])
```

Each of these just returns a function that modifies the logic, what we call a `LogicBuilder`:

```ts
// part of `actions` from kea core 
function actions<L extends Logic = Logic>(input: any): LogicBuilder<L> {
  return (logic) => {
    for (const [key, payload] of input) {
      logic.actionsCreators[key] = createAction(key, payload)
      logic.actions[key] = (...args: any[]) => dispatch(logic.actionsCreators[key](...args))
      // etc...
    }
  }
}
```

Your final `logic` is just a combination of all applied logic builders.

## Lifecycles

A `logic` can be in three different states:

```ts
// 1. Initialized
const loginLogic = kea([...builders])

// 2. Built
const builtLoginLogic = loginLogic.build()

// 3. Mounted
const unmount = builtLoginLogic.mount()
```

1. **Initialized**. When your JS interpreter encounters a `kea([...builders])` call, it stores the `builders` for later.
2. **Built**. To build a logic, apply all logic builders. The result is an object with various properties, but
   which doesn't do much.
3. **Mounted**. Once a logic is built, it can be mounted. This means attaching its the `reducers` to
   Redux, making its `selectors` actually point to a `value` in the store, registering all `listeners` handlers, firing all `afterMount` events, and so on.

If you use Kea with React though [hooks](../hooks), logic is mounted automatically.  When all components
that use a `logic` are removed from React's tree, that `logic` will be unmounted automatically.

## Mounting and Unmounting

When you use [Kea with React](/docs/BROKEN), there's a lot that is handled for you behind the scenes.
For example logic is mounted automatically with your `<Component />` and unmounted when it's no longer needed.

Sometimes however, you wish to manually mount logic. For example to already start loading data in
your router before transitioning to a component... or in `getInitialProps` in next.js... or when writing
tests with Jest.

Perhaps you even want to use Kea with a framework other than React.

In any case, just call `mount()` on your logic and get as a reply a function that will `unmount` it:

```javascript
// create the counter logic from some of the previous examples
const logic = kea([ ... ])

// connect its reducers to redux
const unmount = logic.mount()

logic.values.counter
// => 0

logic.actions.increment()
// => { type: 'increment ...', payload: { amount: 1 } }

logic.values.counter
// => 1

// remove reducers from redux
unmount()

logic.values.counter
// => throw new Error()!
```

In case you need to pass props to your logic, for example if it is [keyed](/docs/BROKEN),
you should [build the logic](/docs/BROKEN) explicitly before calling `mount()` on it:

```javascript
// create the counter logic from the examples above, but with a key!
const logic = kea([ key(props => props.id), ... ])

// build the logic with props (`logic(props)` is short for `logic.build(props)`)
const logicWithProps = logic({ id: 123, otherProp: true })

const unmount = logicWithProps.mount()

// do what needs to be done
logicWithProps.actions.increment()

// call `logic()` again with the same key if you want to update the other props
logic({ id: 123, otherProp: false })

unmount()
```

There are a few other options you can use. See the [logic API](/docs/BROKEN) for more details.



## Input objects vs functions

Whenever you're using any of kea's built-in primitives (`actions`, `reducers`, `listeners`, etc),
you have two options.

You can pass objects to them:

```javascript
kea([
  actions({
    increment: true,
  }),
  listeners({
    increment: () => {
      console.log('incrementing!')
    },
  }),
])
```

... or you can pass functions to them:

```javascript
kea([
  actions(() => ({
    // added "() => ("
    increment: true,
  })), // added ")"
  listeners(() => ({
    // added "() => ("
    increment: () => {
      console.log('++!')
    },
  })), // added ")"
])
```

What's the difference?

First, if you pass a function, it gets evaluated lazily when the logic is built.

If you're using values that are not guaranteed to be there (e.g. a reducer that uses
`otherLogic.actionTypes.something`), pass a function:

```javascript
kea([
  reducers(() => ({
    // evaluate later
    counter: [
      0,
      {
        increment: (state) => state + 1,
        // controlLogic.actions is undefined when loading this code
        // so we must wrap a function around it
        [controlLogic.actionTypes.setCounter]: (_, { counter }) => counter,
      },
    ],
  })),
])
```

Second, the function you pass gets one argument, `logic`, which you
can destructure to get `actions`, `values` and other goodies on the logic that you're building:

```javascript
kea([
  listeners(({ actions, values }) => ({
    increment: () => {
      if (values.iHaveHadEnough) {
        actions.doSomethingElse()
      }
    },
  })),
])
```

The recommendation is to write the simplest code you can (start with an `reducers: {}`)
and when you need to access `actions`, `values` or perform lazy evaluation, convert it into
a function.


## Calling `logic.mount()` inside listeners

In Kea 2.0 logic automatically connects when used inside another logic.

Assuming `counterLogic` is not used anywhere else, when called in the listener here,
it will be automatically built and mounted:

```javascript
// Works in Kea 2.1+
const logic = kea([
  actions({
    showCount: true,
  }),
  listeners({
    showCount: () => {
      console.log('Increment called!')
      console.log(`Counter: ${counterLogic.values.counter}`)
    },
  }),
])
```

It will also remain mounted for as long as `logic` is mounted.

What if you don't want that and instead prefer to mount and unmount `counerLogic` manually within
the listener?

A practical example of this is to mount a logic to preload data on a route change 150ms before
transitioning the scene... and then to unmount it manually once the page loaded. It's enough to
prevent the "flash of loading" in most cases.

Instead of directly calling `logic.mount()`, you just need to build the logic fist, even if it
doesn't need any props. You must then pass `false` as the second argument to `.build`:

```javascript
// Works in Kea 2.0+
const logic = kea({
  actions: {
    showCount: true,
  },
  listeners: {
    showCount: () => {
      // counterLogic.build(props, autoConnectInListener)
      const builtCounterLogic = counterLogic.build({}, false)
      const unmount = builtCounterLogic.mount()

      console.log('Incrementing!')
      builtCounterLogic.actions.increment()

      console.log(`Counter: ${builtCounterLogic.values.counter}`)

      unmount() // and it's gone!
    },
  },
})
```

Instead of using `logic(props)` to build the logic, use `logic.build(props, false)`.

Without explicitly setting this second argument (`autoConnectInListener`) to false,
`counterLogic` would have been automatically built and mounted on `counterLogic.values`.

Calling `.mount()` on a built and mounted logic won't mount it twice, but it will stay mounted
until the returned `unmount` is called, even if no other logic is connected to it.

## Extending logic

Up until a logic has been built and mounted, you can extend it:

```javascript
const logic = kea([
  actions({
    increment: (amount = 1) => ({ amount }),
    decrement: (amount = 1) => ({ amount }),
  }),

  reducers({
    counter: [
      0,
      {
        increment: (state, { amount }) => state + amount,
        decrement: (state, { amount }) => state - amount,
      },
    ],
  }),
])

logic.extend({
  reducers: {
    negativeCounter: [
      0,
      {
        increment: (state, { amount }) => state - amount,
        decrement: (state, { amount }) => state + amount,
      },
    ],
  },
})

// later in React
const { counter, negativeCounter } = useValues(logic)
```

Extending logic is especially powerful when [writing plugins](/docs/BROKEN). For
example to dynamically add actions, reducers or listeners to a logic, based on some key.
