# React

## Hooks for functional components

You use hooks to pull down actions and values from your logic. 

When you use a hook, Kea makes sure the logic is mounted as your component renders, and is
automatically unmounted when your component is removed from React.

- [`useActions`](/docs/react/useActions)
- [`useAllValues`](/docs/react/useAllValues)
- [`useMountedLogic`](/docs/react/useMountedLogic)
- [`useSelector`](/docs/react/useSelector)
- [`useValues`](/docs/react/useValues)

## Wrapping for class components

- [`wrap`](/docs/react/wrap)

## BindLogic

Use React Context to remember a logic's props down the tree.

- [`BindLogic`](/docs/react/BindLogic)
