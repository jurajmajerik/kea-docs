# path

## Setting the path manually

In order to help debugging, you may manually specify a `path` for your logic.

```typescript
kea([
  path(['scenes', 'dashboard']),
])
```

This doesn't change how Kea behaves, but helps when inspecting the state and actions.

See the [debugging](/docs/intro/debugging) doc for more.
